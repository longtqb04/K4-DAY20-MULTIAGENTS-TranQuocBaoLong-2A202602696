### Human
The test suite of the `bookings` package in the folder `workspace/` is failing.

Fix the source code so that the whole test suite passes and every function does what its docstring says.
The visible tests do not cover everything: the docstrings are the specification.
Do not modify the existing files in `tests/`.
Your changes are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme Python team conventions.

When you are done, reply with a short summary of what you changed and why.

### Assistant
Here are the findings and necessary changes based on the analysis of the source code in the `bookings` package.

### Changes Made:

1. **`billing.py`**:
   - The `billable_blocks` function was missing a check for negative `minutes` and did not raise a `ValueError` accordingly. I added the condition to raise `ValueError` when `minutes < 0`.

   ```python
   def billable_blocks(minutes, block=15):
       """Number of billable blocks for a booking."""
       if minutes < 0:
           raise ValueError("minutes must be >= 0.")
       return round(minutes / block)
   ```

2. **`calendar_export.py`**:
   - No issues were found in this file; it correctly calculates the end time of a slot using `parse_duration`.

3. **`schedule.py`**:
   - The `add_slot` function was not creating a new list as specified. Instead, it was modifying the existing list. I modified it to create a new list each time the function is called.

   ```python
   def add_slot(slot, slots=[]):
       """Return a NEW list containing the given slots plus `slot`."""
       new_slots = slots.copy()  # Create a copy of the slots
       new_slots.append(slot)
       return new_slots
   ```

4. **`timeutil.py`**:
   - The `parse_duration` function did not handle all specified formats correctly. I have added the logic to handle the `h` and `m` formats, as well as the format for a time `1:30` for conversion into minutes.

   ```python
   def parse_duration(text):
       """Convert a duration string to whole minutes (int).""
